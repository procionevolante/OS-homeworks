# Lab 05 exercise 01
Write a C program, __using the system call `system`__, which takes as its argument a number `k`.

It must produce two text files, `F1.txt` and `F2.txt`, each including `k` random generated integer
numbers, in range `[0 â€“ 1000000]`, one per line. Initialize the random seed with your ID.

It then generates a child. Parent and child must sort, in ascending order, `F1.txt` and `F2.txt`,
respectively, using the shell command `sort`. The parent process must wait the end of its child.

(Command `sort -n -o fname fname` sorts in ascending order the content of
`fname`, and by means of the `-o` option rewrites the content of file `fname` with the sorted numbers.
Option `-n` indicates numeric rather than alphabetic ordering.)

Then, the parent process reads both files, F1.txt and F2.txt, and convert them to binary
format, producing the files `F1.bin` and `F2.bin`.

Finally, the parent process will merge these sorted files, __properly reading one integer at a time
from the two files__, and writing the smallest on the output file `F12.sorted`.
Before terminating, the parent process removes the files `F1.bin`, and `F2.bin`.

You cannot read in memory the content of the two files for sorting, but you can look at this function
to inspire the final part of your main program. Function merge merges two sorted vectors, `v1` and
`v2`, and produces the sorted vector `v3`.

```
void merge(int *, int *v2, int *v3, int N1, int N2){
	i=j=k=0;
	while(i<N1 && j<N2){
		if(v1[i] < v2[j])
			v3[k++] = v1[i++];
		else
			v3[k++] = v2[j++];
	}
	// Copy the remaining values of one of the two vectors
	while(i<N1)
		v3[k++] = v1[i++];
	while(j<N2)
		v3[k++] = v2[j++];
}
```
