# Lab 04 exercise 02
Modify the range of `n1` and `n2` in parent-child to `[0-100]`. Remake.
Run **3** instances of the program parent-child in background
using the command:  
`parent-child & parent-child & parent-child &`  
From a different shell, use `ps` to figure out the PID, and the status, of all
the parents and children processes.
Terminate **4** of those processes, use `ps` again to figure out the PID, and
the status of all remaining processes.
