# Lab 12 exercise 03
A text file (ASCII) has indefinite format, that is, includes an indefinite
number of lines each of which includes an indefinite number of strings.

Implement a `bash` script that can display on standard output the number of
occurrences of each string present in a file (filename given in the command
line).

Tips: use two vectors, one for storing words, and one for storing the number of occurrences.
