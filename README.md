Here there are my solutions for the Operating Systems' laboratories
(course 04JEZLM at Polytechnic of Turin).

I hope they may be useful to someone.

## Structure
Each second-level directory contains an exercise solution, along with the
exercise text and the corresponding report.

## Notes
* PDF files from lab04 onwards are generated using the OSHFG (O.S. Homeworks'
File Generator) from another one of my repos (but directories have been
renamed: for instance `lab08` was `S235808_L08_AndreaFanti` originally)

* since 2018/2019 is the first a.y. in which `awk` is not taught, some
exercises are also solved using this language since I learned it as an hobby.
